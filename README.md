# JavaScript Null/Undefined Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript: failure to handle null or undefined values. The `bug.js` file shows a function that incorrectly handles null inputs.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.  This example highlights the importance of comprehensive input validation and null checks in JavaScript.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `bug.js` and `bugSolution.js` in a JavaScript environment (browser console, Node.js, etc.)
3. Run the code to see the difference in behavior between the erroneous and corrected versions.
